    Learnings of Episode 02 - Igniting our app 

    ðŸ”µnpm init 
      now we have package.json

      setup bundler =  npm install -D parcel (dev dependencies)
      we have parcel installed which is a bundler
      now we have node_modules installed, package-lock.json

    ðŸ”µto run npx parcel index.html(entry point)
    ðŸ”µto build npx parcel build index.html

    ðŸ”µ installing react and react-dom and removed cdn links

    ðŸ”µ transitive dependencies - when we install a package it uses some other packages and they might use some other packages so these dependencies are saved in node modules and their metadata in package-lock.json and all these dependencies are  called transitive dependencies.

    ðŸ”µ every dependency has its own package.json can be seen in node_modules
    ðŸ”µ always add node_modules in .gitignore
    ðŸ”µ all node_modules can be get back by just npm install 
    ðŸ”µ now add browserlists to make our code compatible with previous browser versions
        visit: https://browserslist.dev/  for more browser versions info
