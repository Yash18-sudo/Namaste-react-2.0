    ðŸŸ¢ Passing props and using it (example below)
    
    <RestaurantCard
            resname ="Meghana Foods"
            cuisine = "Biryani, North-indian food, Asian, chinese"
            
            //Above two lines are props that are passed to the component similar to passing an argument in the function and these props are received as an object in the component

            //For dynamically passing data we use props in react
        />
        <RestaurantCard
            resname="kfc"
            cuisine ="Burger,Chicken wings,fast-food"
        />

    and these props can be used as shown below

    const RestaurantCard = (props)=>{
    return <div className="res-card">
        <img src='https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_208,h_208,c_fit/ylrwt0lclcwr4gyreufb'></img>
        <h3>{props.resname}</h3>
        <h4>{props.cuisine}</h4>
        <h4>star rating</h4>
        <h4>Timing</h4>
    </div>
    }

    Instead of writing it as in line number 33 we can also write it as shown below and can be directly accesed with their name this is called destructing on the fly
        
    const RestaurantCard = ({resname, cuisine})=>{
    and use it as 
        <h3>{resname}</h3>
        <h4>{cuisine}</h4>
